      <h2>Renewable Energy Centre</h2>
      <p>
        PASE has plans to build a biogas plant which will utilize the 
        waste from its farm and mill, as well as those from other farms 
        and the nearby schools and households to meet its energy needs 
        and to supply the school, if possible. It will also explore and 
        promote other forms of renewable energy.

      <h2>Extension Service</h2>
      <p>
        PASE will provide an extension service to farmers by making 
        the results from research centres and institutions of higher 
        learning across the country directly available to them. PASE 
        will seek development assistance funding to organise farmer 
        field schools (FFS) for farmers within the immediate catchment 
        area. In addition, the company will use such funding to put an 
        input supply scheme in place so that farmers can have access to 
        genuine and affordable inputs, and receive practical training in 
        their application during the FFS.
