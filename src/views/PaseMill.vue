        <p>
          Going forward, we plan to set up a seedling market to ensure 
          that any interested farmer can purchase quality seedlings at 
          an affordable price, and an agricultural input shop to help 
          farmers secure the inputs they need conveniently and at affordable prices.

        <h2>High quality crude palm oil (CPO)</h2>
        <p>
          The oil from our artisanal mill has been independently tested by the 
          laboratories of both Juaben Oil Mills and Avnash Industries Ghana 
          Ltd. and shown to contain fatty acids well below the level needed 
          to meet international standards.

        <h2>Made in Ghana</h2>
        <p>
          In 20xx we began to partner with Solidaridad to construct a much larger 
          semi-industrial mill in Mankranso with the capacity to process 3 
          tonnes per hour.  Our engineer worked the Solidaridad technical 
          consultant to design our own bespoke machines. These have mostly 
          been fabricated locally by local welders, demonstrating the potential 
          for us to manufacture our own good quality industrial equipment in Ghana. 
          We hope to inspire young engineers at Ghanaian tertiary institutions 
          and beyond to do the same.
