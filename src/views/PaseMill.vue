        <h2>Production Centre</h2>
        <p>
          PASE will be a production centre for sustainable, inexpensive and 
          environmentally sound agricultural production, starting with the 
          manufacture of crude palm oil. Soon after, it plans to use the 
          by-products to produce crude palm kernel oil and palm kernel cake. 
          The latter will be used to feed animals that it plans to keep and 
          the surplus, for sale as animal feed. Five years into production, 
          the company also hopes to produce refined palm oil for human 
          consumption from the crude palm oil. It could also venture into soap 
          making, using the palm kernel oil.
        </p>

        <p>
          The company’s strategy will be to expand its palm oil production 
          capabilities to serve the communities surrounding Mankranso. Our 
          ultimate objective is to enter the international market. For this 
          reason, the company will expand its production plant gradually, 
          and establish a niche within the community as the most reliable 
          company. It is already in discussion with farmers in the area to 
          come into contractual agreement where PASE will take over the 
          management of their farms so as to secure the produce. In addition, 
          PASE will also acquire more plantation where eventually 50% of raw 
          materials could be sourced from the company’s own estates.
