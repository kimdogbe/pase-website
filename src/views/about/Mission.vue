        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          PASE seeks to promote the dynamic, integrated human 
          development of farm households, by using locally available, 
          environmentally sustainable, and affordable resources. We do 
          this by simultaneously spurring agricultural production and 
          processing, mechanisation, and extension services, while 
          building on indigenous knowledge. We particularly aim to 
          support women and young farmers. We also seek to nurture a 
          sense of ownership of the development process among the people 
          and communities in which PASE operates, and to celebrate 
          Ghanaian technical innovation.   
        </p>
        <p>
          PASE aims to inspire community-spirited individuals to venture 
          into social enterprise as a sustainable way of empowering poor 
          and marginalised people.
