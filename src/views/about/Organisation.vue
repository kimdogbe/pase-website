        <p>
          PDA is renowned for its inclusive values and participatory methods. 
          As a sister company, PASE uses the same principles and approaches. 
          For example, the workers meet periodically with board and staff to 
          discuss and shape the company vision so that they can contribute their 
          insights and feel part of the development of the company.
