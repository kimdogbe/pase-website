        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          We are passionate about practically demonstrating a model of development that works for everyone, not just a few. We believe that everyone matters.
        </p>
        <p><strong>PASE aims to demonstrate that:</strong></p>
        <ul class="mb-4">
          <li>an agriculture-based enterprise can also be a social enterprise – benefitting everyone involved,</li>
          <li>business in general can bring about human development and still make a profit,</li>
          <li>agriculture has a bright future, especially for our young people,</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>
            In the longer term, our plan is that the PASE farm and mill will be at the centre of a thriving, 
            exemplary social enterprise that will serve as an inspirational model 
            within Ghana and beyond, and contributing to the country becoming one where:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-4">
          <li>people choose to set up ‘businesses with a conscience’ as a way of bringing prosperity to poor and marginalised people,</li>
          <li>farmers (especially young and female farmers) are confident of having a ready market and fair prices for their produce and therefore choose primary and secondary agriculture* as a gainful source of employment instead of migrating to urban centres,</li> 
          <li>public sector and private sector work in partnership to support farmers, providing them with agricultural extension services, including the supply of agrochemicals and affordable micro-agricultural equipment,</li>
          <li>agriculture is practiced in an environmentally sustainable manner using organic and integrated pest management practices,</li>
          <li>waste from agriculture is used to generate bioenergy for both domestic and economic purposes,</li>
          <li>school education is practical and relevant, utilising the knowledge, skills, expertise and experience of people and enterprises within a locality to improve agricultural production,</li>
          <li>private enterprises in the formal, informal, and traditional sectors of the economy, use their facilities to benefit educational institutions in the area they operate from.</li>
          <li>university and polytechnic students work with farmers during placements and vacations, applying the scientific and technological knowledge they have acquired to solve real challenges facing farmers, resulting in innovation and increased production.</li>
        </ul>
