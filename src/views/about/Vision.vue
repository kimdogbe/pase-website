          PASE aims to demonstrate that:
          <li>an agriculture-based enterprise can also be a social enterprise â€“ benefitting everyone involved,</li>
          <li>business in general can bring about human development and still make a profit,</li>
          <li>agriculture has a bright future, especially for our young people,</li>
