          www.csir.org.gh/index.php/research-institutes/oil-palm-research provides 
          technical and agronomic advice to PASE to help us with our oil palm development,

        <h2>Solidaridad</h2>
        <p>
          Solidaridad worked with PASE under the Sustainable West Africa oil Palm Program 
          (SWAPP) to train some of the smallholder farmers in the PASE area in Best Management 
          Practices (BMP). These help the farmers to increase their yield while protecting the environment. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Solidaridad has also supported us to establish our 3-ton-per-hour mill, which is 
          on the way to helping us to process crude oil palm from smallholder farmers at 
          greater scale and gives the farmers somewhere local and reliable to sell their fresh fruit bunches to.
