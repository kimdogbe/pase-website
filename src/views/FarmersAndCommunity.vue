        <h1>Support for Farmers and Communities</h1>
        <p>PASE aims to demonstrate that farming can enable people to make a 
          comfortable living in a way that is environmentally sustainable and 
          also benefits the families and communities of the farmers.

        <h2>What development for Ghana?</h2>
        <p>These photographs highlight the stark choice we need to make as 
          Ghanaians about how we use our land in a way that ensures it will
           continue to be fertile for next generations. They show illegal 
           ‘galamsey’ (small-scale gold mining) operators working next to 
           our farm in 2017, gradually encroaching on the land and felling 
           our trees.  Galamsey is banned by the government. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/03/ghana-gold-mining-cocoa-environment/">It destroys 
           eco-systems and pollutes water bodies and land.</a> It tempts young 
           people away from education to make quick money and disrupts community life.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope to show young people in particular, that agriculture can 
          provide a sustainable livelihood that doesn’t destroy the environment 
          on which future generations will depend. Agricultural production that 
          benefits all, or extraction of our precious resources for a few?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also working to comply with <a href="https://rspo.org/about">RSPO</a> standards. Our courses in 
          Best Farm Management Practices make local farmers aware of the 
          benefits of taking care of the environment and teach them some 
          of the methods they can use, such as frond stacking, to protect it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Small-scale palm oil production avoids the destruction of eco-systems 
          over vast swathes of land, as happens in other palm oil producing countries. 
          It also ensures that the farmers have other crops to rely on for their food and livelihoods.

        <h2>Farmer Support Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Farmer Support Services unit of PASE is responsible for the 
          supply of farm inputs such as agrochemicals, harvesting tools etc. 
          to farmers. PASE provides these inputs to the smallholder farmers 
          on credit and the farmers pay for them through the proceeds from 
          their fresh fruit bunches (FFB) until the amount is fully paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FSS unit trains the farmers in the communities in the PASE 
          catchment area to help them improve their farm and business management 
          practices. This dramatically improves their yields, and thus their 
          household income because PASE provides a ready market for their 
          increased farm produce. It also means they can earn more on the 
          same piece of land. The staff from PASE also visit farmers on their 
          farms to provide technical advice and help farmers map their farms 
          so that they know their size and potential.

        <h2>Training for farmers</h2>
        <p>
          PASE organises training programmes for farmers to help them improve 
          their farm and financial management. Our popular programme: Best 
          Farm Management Practices, is a practical, hands-on 2-day course, 
          organised on an Individual's farm in a community to help farmers 
          to learn new ways of increasing their yields. They learn about the 
          importance of pruning and how to prune, frond stacking, weed 
          control and how to harvest. The practice of frond stacking helps 
          farms to retain moisture, protects the soil from erosion, adds 
          nutrients and keeps the farm tidy. The farms of participants are 
          also mapped to help them know the correct location and size of 
          their farms. Past trainees have spoken highly of the huge difference 
          it made to their yield and thus their income.

        <h2>Smallholder Farmer Mobilization</h2>
        <p>
          PASE mobilizes FFB from smallholder farmers to supplement the FFB it 
          produces on PASE farms. The mobilization of farmers is a PASE priority 
          because it ensures continued production of crude palm oil and keep 
          the mill running for all to use. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, the lack of reliable buyers meant that many farmers 
          resorted to converting their oil palm farms backs into other land 
          uses. PASE farmer mobilization provides a reliable market and has 
          whipped up interest in oil palm farming and development.

        <h2>VSLA Micro-Fund</h2>
        <p>
          PASE communities are part of the Village Savings and Loans Association 
          (VSLA) Micro-Fund Project run by Participatory Development Associates 
          (PDA), PASE’s sister organization.  This is designed to improve the 
          financial resilience of rural community members through the mobilization 
          of local resources and the provision of additional credit support. 
          Community members save together as a group, and the project offers 
          business and financial literacy training to help them boost their 
          productivity and ensure sustainable financial management. Digital 
          payment systems are also introduced to promote digital financial 
          transactions in rural communities. The VSLA Micro-Fund Project uses 
          VSLA-GALS methodology and aims to improve the productivity and 
          sustainable financial management and resilience of beneficiaries.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Women and men in rural communities often find it challenging to access 
          financial services. This is due to several factors including: lack of 
          collateral and ownership of assets, poor financial management, the 
          risky nature of farming, and their inability to prepare viable project 
          proposals. This impedes the development of their livelihoods and of 
          agriculture and rural enterprises more widely. It also prevents timely 
          adoption of new technology, which requires investment. Ensuring 
          financial inclusion, where individuals and businesses have access to 
          useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their 
          needs is therefore an important step in reducing poverty and promoting development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small-scale farmers are widely perceived by financial organisations as 
          risky and costly to serve and are thus frequently neglected. While they can 
          save and mobilize resources, these are usually insufficient for transforming their 
          operations and lifting them out of the vicious cycle of poverty. Additional credit 
          support can be the catalyst that ensures that small scale farmers can buy farm inputs, 
          adopt simple farming technologies, and diversify their income sources through off-farm 
          microenterprises. This can be life changing. Lending to groups, and savings and 
          loans cooperatives, can drastically reduce transaction costs, and levels of risk. 
          Strong village cooperative systems and social cohesiveness almost always result 
          in high rates of loan recovery.

        <h2>PASE Community Nursery</h2>
        <p>
          PASE supports communities to set up their own community nurseries. These help 
          farmers who are far away from seedling markets to raise their own good quality 
          seedlings for their oil palm farms. It also helps them to plan ahead. Groups are 
          formed with a maximum of ten farmers to collectively raise the seedlings. PASE 
          then supervises the project and provides any technical assistance needed. PASE 
          can also provide the necessary inputs, such as seed-nuts and polybags, on credit.

        <h2>Youth Employment</h2>
        <p>
          PASE has already given work to many people in the local area around Kunsu. 
          We want to inspire young farmers, agricultural processors and engineers to do the same.
