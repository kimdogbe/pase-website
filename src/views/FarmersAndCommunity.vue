        <h2>Farmer Support Services</h2>
        <p>The Farmer Support Services unit of PASE is responsible 
          for the supply of farm inputs such as agrochemicals, harvesting
          tools etc. to farmers. PASE provide these inputs to the 
          smallholder farmers on credit and the farmers pay through their 
          FFB proceeds until the amount is fully paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unit train the farmers in the communities in our catchment area 
          to improve their farm management practices. This dramatically 
          improves their yields, and thus their household income because PASE 
          provides a ready market for their increased farm produce. It also 
          means they can earn more on the same piece of land. The unit offer 
          farm visitation services to provide specific technical advice and 
          mapping of farm to help farmers determine the size of their farms.

        <h2>PASE Farm</h2>
        <p>
          PASE has plans to ensure that it guarantees more than 50% of 
          the total FFB supply to the mill from PASE farms. This informed 
          the decision of PASE farm expansion. The farm expansion will 
          ensure a reliable and continuous supply of FFB to the mill 
          reception even in the major lean season.
        </p>
        <p>
          PASE has acquired 200 acres of farmland at Boatengkrom near Kunsu 
          for plantation development. Currently, PASE has established 10 
          acres of oil palm on the farmland.

        <h2>PASE Partner Farm</h2>
        <p>
          PASE is open to farmers with farmlands who intend to engage in ‘Abunu’ 
          land tenure of farming. The farmland will be inspected and ensure the 
          requisite due diligence for the agreement is followed before the 
          commencement of the plantation development. This is to avoid future 
          litigations.

          A farmer from Boahenkwaa Santasi near Essienkyem in the Ahafo Ano South 
          of Ashanti Region is collaborating with PASE to establish 33.66 acres 
          oil palm plantation.

        <h2>Smallholder Farmer Mobilization</h2>
        <p>
          PASE mobilizes FFB from smallholder farmers to supplement the FFB from 
          PASE farms. The mobilization of farmers is a PASE priority because it 
          ensures continues production of CPO. Due to lack of reliable buyers many 
          farmers resorted to converting their oil palm plantations into other 
          land uses. PASE farmer mobilization there provides a reliable market 
          and has whipped up interest in oil palm plantation development.

        <h2>PASE Nursery</h2>
        <p>
          PASE has set up 2 nursery projects with 3,000 and 5,000 seedlings 
          respectively. The seedlings were meant for the establishment of the 200 
          acres plantation at Boatengkrom but due to interest from farmers’ some 
          have been offered for sale. A seedlings market will be developed to 
          ensure that any interested farmer can purchase quality seedlings at an 
          affordable price.

        <h2>PASE Community Nursery</h2>
        <p>
          PASE has an agenda to help farmers who are far from its seedlings market 
          to raise their own seedlings in their various communities. Groups are 
          formed with a maximum of ten farmers to collectively raise the seedlings. 
          PASE supervises the project and provide assistance throughout the project. 
          PASE acquires all the necessary material such as seednuts and polybags for 
          the project on credit to the farmers.

        <h2>Resource, Educational and Training Centre</h2>
        <p>
          As a resource centre for training small-scale farmers, especially 
          the youth, women, and persons with disability, in successful crop 
          production, livestock production, and possibly fish farming, PASE 
          will put a scheme in place for students in Junior High Schools 
          (JHS) and Senior High Schools (SHS) in the districts, and possibly 
          beyond, to come on excursions and tours to the farm and the oil 
          mill. Some will be encouraged to come and work during the 
          vacations to gain practical experience. There will also be an 
          apprenticeship scheme to train the out-of school youth. In all 
          these, women and girls will be given preference.
