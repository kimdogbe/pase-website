        <h2>Smallholder Farmer Mobilization</h2>
        <p>
          PASE mobilizes FFB from smallholder farmers to supplement the FFB it 
          produces on PASE farms. The mobilization of farmers is a PASE priority 
          because it ensures continued production of crude palm oil and keep 
          the mill running for all to use. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, the lack of reliable buyers meant that many farmers 
          resorted to converting their oil palm farms backs into other land 
          uses. PASE farmer mobilization provides a reliable market and has 
          whipped up interest in oil palm farming and development.
