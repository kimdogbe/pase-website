        <h2>What development for Ghana?</h2>
        <p>These photographs highlight the stark choice we need to make as 
          Ghanaians about how we use our land in a way that ensures it will
           continue to be fertile for next generations. They show illegal 
           ‘galamsey’ (small-scale gold mining) operators working next to 
           our farm in 2017, gradually encroaching on the land and felling 
           our trees.  Galamsey is banned by the government. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/03/ghana-gold-mining-cocoa-environment/">It destroys 
           eco-systems and pollutes water bodies and land.</a> It tempts young 
           people away from education to make quick money and disrupts community life.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope to show young people in particular, that agriculture can 
          provide a sustainable livelihood that doesn’t destroy the environment 
          on which future generations will depend. Agricultural production that 
          benefits all, or extraction of our precious resources for a few?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also working to comply with <a href="https://rspo.org/about">RSPO</a> standards. Our courses in 
          Best Farm Management Practices make local farmers aware of the 
          benefits of taking care of the environment and teach them some 
          of the methods they can use, such as frond stacking, to protect it.

          Small-scale palm oil production avoids the destruction of eco-systems 
          over vast swathes of land, as happens in other palm oil producing countries. 
          It also ensures that the farmers have other crops to rely on for their food and livelihoods.
