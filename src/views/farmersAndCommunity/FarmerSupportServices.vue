        <h2>Farmer Support Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Farmer Support Services unit of PASE is responsible for the 
          supply of farm inputs such as agrochemicals, harvesting tools etc. 
          to farmers. PASE provides these inputs to the smallholder farmers 
          on credit and the farmers pay for them through the proceeds from 
          their fresh fruit bunches (FFB) until the amount is fully paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FSS unit trains the farmers in the communities in the PASE 
          catchment area to help them improve their farm and business management 
          practices. This dramatically improves their yields, and thus their 
          household income because PASE provides a ready market for their 
          increased farm produce. It also means they can earn more on the 
          same piece of land. The staff from PASE also visit farmers on their 
          farms to provide technical advice and help farmers map their farms 
          so that they know their size and potential.
