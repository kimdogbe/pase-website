        <h2>Training for farmers</h2>
        <p>
          PASE organises training programmes for farmers to help them improve 
          their farm and financial management. Our popular programme: Best 
          Farm Management Practices, is a practical, hands-on 2-day course, 
          organised on an Individual's farm in a community to help farmers 
          to learn new ways of increasing their yields. They learn about the 
          importance of pruning and how to prune, frond stacking, weed 
          control and how to harvest. The practice of frond stacking helps 
          farms to retain moisture, protects the soil from erosion, adds 
          nutrients and keeps the farm tidy. The farms of participants are 
          also mapped to help them know the correct location and size of 
          their farms. Past trainees have spoken highly of the huge difference 
          it made to their yield and thus their income.
