        <h2>PASE Community Nursery</h2>
        <p>
          PASE supports communities to set up their own community nurseries. These help 
          farmers who are far away from seedling markets to raise their own good quality 
          seedlings for their oil palm farms. It also helps them to plan ahead. Groups are 
          formed with a maximum of ten farmers to collectively raise the seedlings. PASE 
          then supervises the project and provides any technical assistance needed. PASE 
          can also provide the necessary inputs, such as seed-nuts and polybags, on credit.
