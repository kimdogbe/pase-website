        <h2>VSLA Micro-Fund</h2>
        <p>
          PASE communities are part of the Village Savings and Loans Association 
          (VSLA) Micro-Fund Project run by Participatory Development Associates 
          (PDA), PASEâ€™s sister organization.  This is designed to improve the 
          financial resilience of rural community members through the mobilization 
          of local resources and the provision of additional credit support. 
          Community members save together as a group, and the project offers 
          business and financial literacy training to help them boost their 
          productivity and ensure sustainable financial management. Digital 
          payment systems are also introduced to promote digital financial 
          transactions in rural communities. The VSLA Micro-Fund Project uses 
          VSLA-GALS methodology and aims to improve the productivity and 
          sustainable financial management and resilience of beneficiaries.

        <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Women and men in rural communities often find it challenging to access 
          financial services. This is due to several factors including: lack of 
          collateral and ownership of assets, poor financial management, the 
          risky nature of farming, and their inability to prepare viable project 
          proposals. This impedes the development of their livelihoods and of 
          agriculture and rural enterprises more widely. It also prevents timely 
          adoption of new technology, which requires investment. Ensuring 
          financial inclusion, where individuals and businesses have access to 
          useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their 
          needs is therefore an important step in reducing poverty and promoting development.

          Small-scale farmers are widely perceived by financial organisations as 
          risky and costly to serve and are thus frequently neglected. While they can 
          save and mobilize resources, these are usually insufficient for transforming their 
          operations and lifting them out of the vicious cycle of poverty. Additional credit 
          support can be the catalyst that ensures that small scale farmers can buy farm inputs, 
          adopt simple farming technologies, and diversify their income sources through off-farm 
          microenterprises. This can be life changing. Lending to groups, and savings and 
          loans cooperatives, can drastically reduce transaction costs, and levels of risk. 
          Strong village cooperative systems and social cohesiveness almost always result 
          in high rates of loan recovery.
