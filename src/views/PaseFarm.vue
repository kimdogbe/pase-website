        <h1>PASE Farm</h1>
        <p>
          PASE wants to ensure that at a large proportion of the fresh fruit bunches 
          (FFB) needed for the PASE mill comes from PASE farms. To add to our 
          original farm, PASE has acquired farmland at Boatengkrom near Kunsu 
          to expand our FFB production. Recently, PASE has planted several 
          acres of oil palm on this land to help ensure future FFB supply to 
          keep the mill running. This will enable us to provide the uninterrupted 
          and reliable service that farmers badly need.

        <h2>Partnering with farmers to manage their farms</h2>
        <p>
          PASE also partners with smallholder farmers who engage in the ‘abunu’ 
          land tenure system. Under this traditional arrangement, the smallholder 
          farmers provide the land for the farm while PASE provides resources and 
          skills to establish and manage the farm to achieve high yields. The 
          proceeds from the farm are then shared between the smallholder farmer and PASE.

        <h2>Smallholder Farmer Mobilization</h2>
        <p>
          PASE mobilizes FFB from smallholder farmers to supplement the FFB from 
          PASE farms. The mobilization of farmers is a PASE priority because it 
          ensures continues production of CPO. Due to lack of reliable buyers many 
          farmers resorted to converting their oil palm plantations into other 
          land uses. PASE farmer mobilization there provides a reliable market 
          and has whipped up interest in oil palm plantation development.

        <h2>PASE Tree Nursery</h2>
        <p>
          PASE has set up two tree nursery projects with 3,000 and 5,000 seedlings 
          respectively. The seedlings were originally intended for PASE farms, but 
          due to keen interest from farmers, some are offered for sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going forward, we plan to set up a seedling market to ensure that any 
          interested farmer can purchase quality seedlings at an affordable price, 
          and an agricultural input shop to help farmers secure the inputs they 
          need conveniently and at affordable prices.

        <h2>Resource, Educational and Training Centre</h2>
        <p>
          As a resource centre for training small-scale farmers, especially 
          the youth, women, and persons with disability, in successful crop 
          production, livestock production, and possibly fish farming, PASE 
          will put a scheme in place for students in Junior High Schools 
          (JHS) and Senior High Schools (SHS) in the districts, and possibly 
          beyond, to come on excursions and tours to the farm and the oil 
          mill. Some will be encouraged to come and work during the 
          vacations to gain practical experience. There will also be an 
          apprenticeship scheme to train the out-of school youth. In all 
          these, women and girls will be given preference.

        <h2>Incubation Centre</h2>
        <p>
          PASE will serve as an incubation centre for the experimentation and
          promotion of agricultural technology and good agricultural 
          practices. In this regard, it will seek to partner any of the 
          country’s universities which will be interested in having their 
          students (during vacations) spend time with farmers in the 
          catchment area to work with farmers in finding technological 
          solutions to challenges facing them.
